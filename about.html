        <h3 class="First_About_Text">As a recent graduate, I am now specializing in ERP development and web development, with a strong focus on React and
        modern web technologies. My academic background and hands-on experience have equipped me with a solid foundation in
        software development and an in-depth understanding of building robust, scalable web applications.
        
        Throughout my studies and personal projects, I have honed my skills in creating visually appealing and highly functional
        websites. I am particularly passionate about leveraging my expertise in React to develop innovative solutions and
        enhance user experiences.

        <h3 class="Second_About_Text_01">I am eager to advance my career as a software engineer or web developer, with a particular interest in automating tasks
        using AI and leveraging technologies like React to build innovative solutions. My passion lies in harnessing the power
        of programming to streamline processes and create efficient, scalable systems.</h3>

        <h2 class="Second_About_Title_02">--What made Me pursue Computer Science?</h2>

        <h3 class="Second_About_Text_02">When I was younger, I was always interested in computers and how they worked. Likewise, I would take apart my family's computer and try to put it back together, but I could never quite figure it out. This made me want to learn more about computers and eventually led me to pursue a degree in computer science. I'm constantly learning new things and challenging myself to solve complex problems. I'm grateful that I chose to pursue a career in computer science, and I would encourage anyone who is interested in computers to do the same.</h3>

        <h3 class="Third_About_Text">There are a few things that I recommend to beginners in computer science. The first is to find a good mentor. A mentor can help guide you through the early stages of learning computer science and can introduce you to concepts that you may not be familiar with. The second is to find a good online resource. There are a lot of free resources available online, and finding a few that you like can help you learn at your own pace. The third is to get involved in the community. There are a lot of great people in the computer science community, and getting involved can help you learn and make connections that can be beneficial in your career.</h3>

        <h3 class="Fourth_About_Text">I regret not learning computer science sooner. I was always interested in computers and how they work, but I never took the time to learn about coding and computer science. I wish I had started sooner, so that I would be further along in my career by now.</h3>
